## About the Game
The Simon Game is a simple yet entertaining memory test. There are four colored buttons: **Red**, **Blue**, **Green**, and **Yellow**. Each round starts with a randomly chosen button that blinks. The player must then click the buttons in the correct sequence. As the player succeeds, the sequence gets longer with every new level.

**Key Highlights:**
- Game starts when the player presses any key on their keyboard.
- Sequence of colors grows with each level.
- A single mistake resets the game to level 1.
- The game was developed purely using front-end languages and jQuery for interactive behavior.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**  
   Press any key on your keyboard to begin. The game will display a level indicator at the top (e.g., "Level 1").

2. **Observe the Pattern**  
   A colored button will blink briefly. Remember which button it was.

3. **Repeat the Sequence**  
   Click on the same button that blinked. If you are correct, you move on to the next level.

4. **Follow the Growing Sequence**  
   Each new level adds one more blink in the sequence. Keep track of the entire sequence in the correct order.

5. **Making a Mistake**  
   If you click the wrong button at any point, you’ll hear a game-over alert, and the game will reset to level 1. Press any key to start over.
